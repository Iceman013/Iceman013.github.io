                    <h2 class="center">The Sock Rebellion</h2>
                    <p>Turmoil has engulfed the Socktopic Isles. The devastating embargo put in place by God King Jon is heavily under dispute.</p>
                    <p>Two warring factions have emerged.</p>
                    <p>One seeks stability and peace. More importantly, they are too scared of Jon to do anything against him. These socks are loyal Jon followers and will do their best to aide him despite Jon's seeming appathy and indifference towards their struggles.</p>
                    <p>The other faction has taken a strong Anti-Jon stance. They have made a new secret rebel base far from the sacred isles to evade Jon's wrath.</p>
                    <p>Although there have been attempts at negotions, Jon refuses to budge, leaving the starving sock alliance with no other options. They have decided to send a full navel fleet against the Socktopic Isles.</p>
                    <p>Jon would usually have his devout followers fight the battle for him because he is a coward. Unfortunately, their numbers dwindle.</p>
                    <p>If Jon runs out of followers, he will lose all of his powers as a god. He is left with no choice but to defend his people and kill any and all attempts at rebellion.</p>
                    <p>He could also agree to their demands instead and save his people a terribly bloody war.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Wow, you stayed here for the whole thing. Thanks. I worked hard on it.</p>
