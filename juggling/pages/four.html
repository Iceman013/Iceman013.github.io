				<h2>Tutorial</h2>
                <div class = "imgCont"><img src = "animations/fourRight.gif"><img src = "animations/fourLeft.gif"></div>
				<text>
					This trick involves two seperate parts done at the same time. Start with two balls in each hand. Then throw from the dominant side.
                    After this, throw from the non-dominant side. Just do two in one hand in both hands. They should not be in sync.
                    Make sure you are throwing from the inside because outside throws will increase the chances of a collision.
				</text>
				<h2>Tips</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						People are generally worse with their non-dominant hand. Practicing that side will help.
					</li>
                    <li>
                        Sometimes, one side will be higher than the other. This will mess up the rhythm. Practice consistency.
                        You can also try to manipulate the height as you go to correct any mistakes.
                    </li>
