				<h2>Description</h2>
				<text>
					The cascade, also known as inside throws, is the basic 3 ball juggling technique. It is typically the first form of juggling one learns.
					This is a simple trick that serves as an introduction to more juggling.
				</text>
				<h2>Tutorial</h2>
				<h4>Step 1</h4>
				<div class = "imgCont"><img src = "animations/cascadeOne.gif" class = "animated"></div>
				<text>
					Start with one ball. Hold it plainly in your hand and throw it across to your other hand. It is important that you throw it up and across.
					It should reach eye level consistently. Do this with your right hand, then left and again. Performing this motion increases consistency which is important.
				</text>
				<h4>Step 2</h4>
				<div class = "imgCont"><img src = "animations/cascadeTwo.gif" class = "animated"></div>
				<text>
					Now 2 balls are needed. Throw the first ball in the style described in step 1. When the ball reaches eye level or peak height, throw the second ball.
					Then catch the first ball. Then catch the second. Do not forget to throw the balls up.
					It may be instictive to pass horizontally between hands but that is incorrect.
					If these 2 balls hit each other in the air, it can be helpful to to throw from the inside and catch on the outside.
					Practice this step starting from each side multiple times.
				</text>
				<h4>Step 3</h4>
				<div class = "imgCont">
					<img src = "animations/cascade.gif" class = "animated">
					<div class = "videoCredit"><img src = "people/Cascade.gif" class = "people"><p class="credit">Video provided by Nathan Gehr</p></div>
				</div>
				<text>
					To start with 3 balls, hold 2 in your dominant hand and 1 in your other hand. To start the pattern, throw one of the 2 in your dominant hand up.
					This should be familiar. Proceed to throw and catch as described in step 2.
					Now that there is another ball in the air, simply throw with the first hand again and then catch.
					This is the last step of the loop and all it takes is repetition.
					This step should result in right throw, left throw, left catch, right throw, right catch, left throw, left catch and so on.
				</text>
				<h2>Tips</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						It can be helpful to think of trading the ball in the air for the one in your hand.
					</li>
					<li>
						If you have trouble at a step, it can be helpful to practice with the previous step some more.
						However, this does take time and practice so you do have to move on to the next step eventually.
					</li>
					<li>
						For some, practicing the steps on the ground can help with learning the pattern.
					</li>
