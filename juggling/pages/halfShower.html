				<h1>Reverse Cascade</h1>
				<div class = "imgCont"><img src = "animations/halfShower.gif"></div>
				<h2>Description</h2>
				<text>
					This is a small variation of the basic 3 ball juggling pattern. It is similar to shower in appearance which is why it has this name.
                    This is often seen as the preparation step for learning shower.

				</ul>
				<h2>Tutorial</h2>
				<text>
					This trick begins with reverse cascade from your dominant hand. Then, do regular cascade with the other hand.
                    Each hand does different things but they always do the same thing.

				<h2>Tips</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						This should look like 2 rainbows.
					</li>
                    <li>
                        This is generally the first asymmetrical trick people learn. That means that it can be done two ways although it takes practice.
                        This will be odd for muscle memory because it feels unbalanced.
                    </li>
