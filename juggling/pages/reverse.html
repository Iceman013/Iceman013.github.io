				<h1>Reverse Cascade</h1>
				<h2>Description</h2>
				<text>
					This is a small variation of the basic 3 ball juggling pattern. It it typically the second trick people learn.
					This is a prerequisite for many variations of the classic 3 ball pattern.
				</text>
				<h2>Tutorial</h2>
				<text>
					This trick is defined as being the opposite of a classic cascade.
					When throwing balls in a cascade, the hand position is closer to the middle and catches are on the outside.
					The reverse cascade is the opposite. Throws come from the outside and catches are in the middle.
				</text>
				<h2>Tips</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Some prefer mixing in one reverse throw while doing regular cascade.
						This can be confusing so it is up to you as to if you start doing it or do a transition.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Fun Facts</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Because of the paths made by regular and reverse cascade, the record for most throws in a minute is faster with reverse cascade.
					</li>
				</ul>
