				<h2>Description</h2>
				<text>
					This is a standard trick that might be people's first thought of what 3 ball juggling is.
					This trick is one of the most simple tricks and easily scalable to higher ball counts.
				</text>
				<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
				<text>
					These are recommended tricks to learn before you do this one. It may help.
				</text>
				<ul id = "prereqs"></ul>
				<h2>Tutorial</h2>
				<h4>Step 1</h4>
				<div class = "imgCont"><img src = "animations/showerThreeOne.gif" class = "animated"></div>
				<text>
					Practice passing from non-dominant to dominant hand. This was forbidden in the cascade trick, but it is essential here.
					The pass is purely horizontal and you should be able to do it reflexively without looking before moving on.
				</text>
				<h4>Step 2</h4>
				<div class = "imgCont"><img src = "animations/showerThreeTwo.gif" class = "animated"></div>
				<text>
					Begin with 1 ball in each hand. Throw a classic upwards throw from you dominant hand. At the same time, perform the pass as described in step 1.
					This should be one fluid motion. It is quick and highly likely that you will mistakenly throw the ball across your practice area.
				</text>
				<br><br>
				<text>
					Another skill that needs to be practiced begins similarly. First throw the ball from the dominant hand into the air.
					When this ball reaches the peak, perform the pass and then catch the ball from the air.
					This is the second half of the motion you are preparing for.
				</text>
				<h4>Step 3</h4>
				<div class = "imgCont"><img src = "animations/showerThree.gif" class = "animated"></div>
				<text>
					This step uses all 3 balls with 2 in the dominant hand and 1 in the other.
					Begin by throwing one from the dominant hand as usual. Then, perform step 2.
					This should be one motion of a simultanious pass and dominant hand throw. This is the only part of the loop.
					This trick is simple in steps as it is one motion looped quickly.
				</text>
				<h2>Tips</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						This trick is asymmetrical. You will need to learn this with both your right and left hands.
					</li>
					<li>
						At first, the motion feels odd because you trained yourself to avoid it during the cascade.
						It will take time to overcome the muscle memory and do this properly.
					</li>
					<li>
						This trick is quick. It may be helpful to increase your throw height to give yourself more time.
					</li>
				</ul>
