					Begin by finding a good place to practice. This should be a long flat stretch next to a wall.
                    The wall should be high enough for you to put your hand on. Finding a perfect place is tough.
                    Using garage doors or a bridge with hand rails generally works.

                <h4>Step 2</h4>
                <text>
                    Place the unicycle parallel to the wall about 2 feet away from it. To mount it, put the right pedal down.
                    (Left works as well but most people learn right sided). Place your right foot on that pedal.
                    Then, shift your weight slowly to that foot/pedal as you swing you other leg on and sit on the seat.
                    Use the wall for balance. Try to get comfortable with this position.
                </text>
                <h4>Step 3</h4>
                <text>
                    Use both hands to move down the wall. Try to stay the same distance from the wall as you go.
                    If you get to the end of the wall,
                    you can either dismount and turn around or turn around while still on the unicycle.
                    Eventually you can use just one hand instead of both. This step will take a while.
                    Once you really get it down, you can let go of the wall a bit and when feeling unsteady,
                    you put your hand back on to balance yourself again.
                </text>
                <h4>Step 4</h4>
                <div class = "imgCont">
					<div class = "videoCredit"><img src = "people/Unicycle1.jpg" class = "people"></div>
				</div>
                <text>
                    Here you can test yourself. Push off from the wall and go as long as you can.
                    This will be the first test of if you can ride. The longer you can do this, the better.
                    If you can go 50 feet, you can say that you can ride.

				<h2>Tips</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						If you have a friend, they can offer an arm for you to hold on to as you ride.
                        Work on lessening the weight you put on that arm until you barely need them at all.
					</li>
                    <li>
                        If you have a friend that can ride, holding hands and riding is a great way to practice.
                        You can both improve your stability as you go.
                        Sadly, if your friend is a master rider, it won't be much different from just holding on to an arm.
                    </li>
