            <h2>Basic Tips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Sometimes, you can get focused on one trick and keep messing up. This is quite frustrating.
                    It can be helpful to have three tricks you are working on and only work on one trick for 15 to 20 minutes at a time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Props are essential. Getting a good prop is important for many reasons. Good quality props can make it easier to learn.
                    Another important factor is familiarity. When you use one prop frequently, you get used to the weight and feel.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Practice with a friend. This makes it more fun and rewarding. You can help each other as you learn.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Prerequisites are available. These can be helpful so you know what order to learn tricks.
                    Although it is recommended that you learn the prerequisites first, this is not necessarily required.
                    Some tricks can be learned out of order, and this may be easier for some people.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Prerequisites often have their own prerequisites. Keep that in mind when you see a trick with only one prerequisite.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Juggling</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Some tricks are very fast. Throwing the items higher in the air can give you more time to react and catch.
                    This requires more consistency but harder tricks are generally done with a higher arc.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you have different colored objects, you can take advantage of them. Use one specific color for one part of the trick and then you can track it.
                    This makes it easier to see what is going on.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The classic props are balls, rings, and clubs. Some tricks are specifically for one or the other.
                    Some tricks can be done with different props, but are less effective or not as clean. Keep that in mind when reading the tags.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Some tricks have multiple steps. If you are able to do the first step but struggle with the second step, practicing the first step more can help.
                    Starting small and working up to the last step builds muscle memory and consistency.
                </li>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Your tire should be well inflated. A flat tire damages the wheel and makes some tricks more difficult.
                    An over-inflated tire can make it far easier to turn. This can be good or bad.
